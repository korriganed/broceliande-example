<i>Keywords: random forests, use-case, Titanic.</i>

This project is a usage example of the [broceliande
project](https://github.com/korriganed/broceliande). It shows how to create
random forests using training data (age, name, number of siblings, etc. of
people that embarked on Titanic) in order to predict an outcome (did they
survive ?). More details on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The
Titanic example allows us to check the result of predictions on an already
happened event.
